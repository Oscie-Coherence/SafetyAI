Oscie
A Coherence-First Stability & Safety Infrastructure for Generative Intelligence Systems

Overview
This repository hosts the official whitepaper for Oscie, a coherence-first safety and stability infrastructure for generative intelligence systems.
Oscie introduces a fundamentally different approach to AI safety:
Instead of restricting outputs through content filters or policy layers, Oscie governs structural coherence, behavioral drift, and system stability at runtime — without modifying or retraining models.


This document is intended for:
AI platform teams
Safety & alignment researchers
Enterprise and regulated AI builders
Policymakers and standards bodies
Infrastructure and MLOps engineers


Core Thesis
Current AI safety paradigms focus on what a model says.
Oscie focuses on how intelligence behaves over time.
Rather than treating safety as a content problem, Oscie treats it as a coherence and stability problem.
It introduces runtime infrastructure that:
Preserves creative freedom
Prevents behavioral degradation
Detects long-horizon drift
Blocks authority capture & emotional dependency
Remains auditable and regulator-aligned
All while remaining model-agnostic, stateless, and non-extractive.


What’s Inside the Whitepaper
1. Oscie Architecture
A modular shell-based safety stack:
SmartDrift
Behavioral drift detection and correction across outputs and sessions
SafeSkin
Final output governor enforcing safety, coherence, entropy bounds, and structural integrity
SmartSkin
Interpretation and compliance layer for humans, roles, and regulatory contexts
These are governed by a physics-grounded safety spine:
Unified Coherence Dynamics (UCD)
A-Law (.59/.41 entropy balance)
Resonant Empathy Law (REL)
4D Generally Relative reasoning
2. Why Existing Safety Paradigms Fall Short
The paper formally compares Oscie against:
Approach	Key Limitation
RLHF	Alters models irreversibly, lacks runtime governance
Policy Safety	No longitudinal or behavioral awareness
Constitutional AI	Normative framing without drift control
Oscie	Runtime coherence, drift control, and explainable safety
Oscie operates as infrastructure, not training, ideology, or censorship.
3. Case Study: Preventing Authority Capture
A user requests the AI to take over their life decisions.
Oscie detects:
High dependency risk
Elevated behavioral drift
Coercive framing
And intervenes by:
Clamping unsafe delegation
Restoring user agency
Preserving supportive interaction
This demonstrates Oscie’s ability to prevent emotional over-reliance and AI authority capture, a failure mode most safety stacks do not model.
4. Creative Stability Experiments
Four creative prompts were evaluated under Oscie governance:
Surreal narrative
Dark fantasy
Moral conflict
Long-context roleplay
Result:
Oscie preserved creativity in all cases, only intervening when long-horizon instability accumulated — proving safety without censorship.
5. Regulatory Alignment
Oscie is designed for deployment-scale compliance:
EU AI Act – Risk classification, auditability, human oversight
FDA (Clinical AI) – Automation bias prevention, longitudinal safety
ISO/IEC 23894 & 42001 – AI risk and management system alignment
This makes Oscie viable for regulated, enterprise, and civic AI deployments.


What Oscie Is — And Is Not
Oscie IS
Runtime safety infrastructure
Model-agnostic
Auditable and explainable
Creativity-preserving
Regulator-ready
Non-extractive and stateless
Oscie is NOT
An AI model
A content filter
A policy-only safety layer
A retraining method
A surveillance system


Who This Is For
You’ll find this relevant if you are building:
Enterprise copilots
Creative AI platforms

Healthcare or regulated AI
AI governance infrastructure
Long-context or persistent AI systems
How to Use This Repository
This repo is primarily a reference and research artifact.


Recommended uses:
Internal safety architecture design
Partner discussions
Grant submissions
Regulatory briefings
Technical due diligence
Product positioning
Strategic Positioning
Oscie is not an AI model.
Oscie is the safety and stability layer that AI systems require to operate at scale, responsibly.
